# iOS Screen Time Page Website

This project emulates the iOS Screen Time passcode page. It is designed to *look* like the real screen so that a parent might unknowingly reveal the Screen Time passcode.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Start by entering a wrong password once.**  
2. **Hand the iPad or iPhone to your parent** so they can enter the real passcode.
3. **Once they enter the passcode**, tap the loading icon GIF **10 times** to reveal the entered digits.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- iPad or iPhone
- Dark mode
*(Light mode is not supported.)*
